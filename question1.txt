Q1. What is cherry-pick? Explain the use case of it also write steps to do it.

Answer:
In the context of version control systems, cherry-picking refers to the act of selecting specific commits from a branch and applying them to another branch. 
This can be useful when you want to apply only a few changes from one branch to another, rather than merging the entire branch.

Use case:
One use case for cherry-picking is when you have made multiple commits on a branch that are intended for separate pull requests or releases. Rather than merging the entire branch, you can cherry-pick the individual commits that you want to apply to the target branch. This can be useful if you want to apply the changes in a specific order, or if you only want to apply some of the changes and not all of them.

Steps for cherry-pick:

1. Check out the branch where you want to apply the cherry-picked commit.
2. Use the git cherry-pick command followed by the commit hash to apply the commit.
3. If there are conflicts, resolve them and commit the changes.
4. Repeat the process for each commit that you want to cherry-pick.

Command:
git cherry-pick `commit-hash`

Below is the demo for cherry-pick:
